        <div>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Ginger</li>
                <li>Fish sauce</li>
                <li>Mirin rice wine</li>
                <li>Brown sugar</li>
                <li>Beef</li>
                <li>Egg noodles</li>
                <li>Cornstarch</li>
                <li>Sesame seeds</li>
                <li>Soy sauce</li>
                <li>Green onions</li>
                <li>Preferable vegetables</li>
            </ul>
        
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Boil the noodles:</strong> Follow the instructions on the pack to cook the noodles. Drain and set aside.</li>
                <li><strong>Coat & cook the beef:</strong> To keep the beef extra tender I coat it in cornstarch before sautéing. This helps to thicken up the sauce as well as prevents overcooking and toughening of the meat. After coating it in cornstarch, I flash fry the flank steak in very hot oil. I also like to cook my steak in batches to prevent overcrowding of the pan and to make sure the beef caramelizes on the outside. Sauté the beef for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until it is cooked, and then set it aside with the noodles.</li>
                <li><strong>Make the teriyaki sauce:</strong> The teriyaki sauce is made of equal parts soy sauce and mirin. Ginger, garlic, and brown sugar also get added for extra flavor and sweetness. The sauce gets nice and thick with a simple cornstarch slurry (1 teaspoon cornstarch + 1 tablespoon cold water).</li>
                <li><strong>Toss and serve:</strong> When the sauce is ready, add the noodles, vegetables and beef back into the pan, and toss them until everything is well coated. Serve it with a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds and green onions!</li>
